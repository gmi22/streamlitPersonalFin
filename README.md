# streamlitPersonalFin


##Description
This Streamlit app allows the user to access a REST API that returns data in JSON format. Using the Numpy and Pandas libraries, the app then manipulates the data and produces various charts and visualizations using Plotly. The user can interact with the app by inputting different parameters to the API and viewing the resulting data in a clear, intuitive format with the help of the plotted charts.
